        -----------
        data: ndarray. shape=(num_test_samps, num_features). Data to predict the class of

        the the log of the right-hand side of Bayes Rule without the denominator (see notebook for
        equation). This can be done without loops.
        - Predict the class of each test sample according to the class that produces the largest
        log(posterior) probability (hint: this can also be done without loops).

        NOTE: Remember that you are computing the LOG of the posterior (see notebook for equation).
        NOTE: The argmax function could be useful here.
